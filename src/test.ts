      noteContent: "This sounds like total BS to me. I've never seen any actual scientists make a prediction about the literal end of the world happening on a specific date like 1/2/2034. That kind of doomsday claim has been made millions of times before by random people and cult leaders but not real scientists. Plus, most Christian churches say you can't actually predict exactly when Jesus will come back, it's unknown. Unless there are credible sources listed that I'm missing, this reads like someone's unfounded personal belief or hoax trying to go viral.",
